# Belted-Trident-300
My take on a belted Voron Trident 300 it has split electronics with the Mains in the bottom and everything else up top. Not all things are completely proven out like the changes made to the filliment holder and stealthmax so use with caution. The rest have about 100hrs without any trouble. The panels and doors in the model are not what I'm using, I have the EMP (Excessively Magnetic Panel Mod) mounts holding them on was waiting for the CAD to be uploaded then change them out. There are a bunch of mods done but for most of them I don't remember where I got them from so am unable to give the original creator credit. If anyone sees something and knows the original creator let me know so I can give them the correct credit. The ones I do remember are.
